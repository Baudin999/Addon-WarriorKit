-- Loadouts
--
-- The macro is the whole feature. Everything else in this part is a panel row
-- or an override binding, and what a key press actually sends is one string on
-- one attribute, so that string is what is asserted: the lines, their order,
-- the two rules that drop a line, the fight that defers the lot, and the
-- delete that has to move every binding under it onto a different button.
--
-- What this cannot prove: that the client runs two /equipslot lines off one
-- press, or what it does with a full bag when a two hander comes off. Nothing
-- installed on either client calls /equipslot, so those two answers are a key
-- press in game and nothing else.
