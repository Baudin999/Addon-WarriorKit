# Todo

Each piece is built by one agent in its own worktree under `.worktrees/`,
on a branch named `worktree-<name>`, and merged into main when
`./scripts/check.sh` comes back at zero. The worktrees stay after the merge.

## Landed

A title and the commit that finished it. Where an item took several commits the
hash is the last of them. What was wrong and what fixed it is in
`docs/CHANGELOG.md` and `docs/README.md`, what is still unconfirmed in game is
in the README's untested list, and the full text of each item is this file at
`e7ef4ca` for 1 to 6, 8, 11 and 12, and at `ca59a77` for 7, 9 and 13.

1. Weapon swing timer. `8be9a43`
2. Deep Wounds missing from the enemy bar debuffs. `05e40ec`
3. Overpower drawn as ready when it is not. `dbbcd69`
4. Missing buff nag, including racials. `042df6c`
5. Enemy cast bar. `89a3e45`
6. Party and raid frames, ours off a secure group header. `e3de603`
7. Cooldown row for the long cooldowns, out of the class registry. `2245a01`
8. The target block linked to the player block, reflected about the middle of
   the screen rather than pinned a fixed distance off it. `2a999b5`
9. Our own buff and debuff rows on the skinned frames. `1871fa6`
11. Split `Skin.lua`, which had three subjects and came apart into four.
    `a5624de`
12. The chat window, reimagined as a rail of rooms. `1c4de0e`
13. What the class split left behind, down to the `Class.Label()` fallback.
    `fc6c0e5`
14. check.sh derives its class shapes from `Class/*.lua` rather than naming
    them. `371d82d`
